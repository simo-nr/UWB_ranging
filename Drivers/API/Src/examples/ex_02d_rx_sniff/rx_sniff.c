/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length. DW IC supports an extended
 *    frame length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 2. Manual reception activation is performed here but DW IC offers several features that can be used to handle more complex scenarios or to
 *    optimise system's overall performance (e.g. timeout after a given time, automatic re-enabling of reception in case of errors, etc.).
 * 3. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but RXFCG and error/timeout status events can be used to generate
 *    interrupts. Please refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
